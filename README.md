### File Watcher

This is an app I've build for a friend of mine. At his company, they had to download a huge amount of data and sometimes the servers crashed. This app alarmes him via text message when there is no more data coming in.

To run this app from the command line:

- npm install twilio
- npm install node-watch
- node watcher.js
